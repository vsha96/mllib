# Contributing to mllib

Welcome to mllib! At the moment we are at the very beginning of the journey.

**Our main goal** is to make a convenient tool for solving machine learning problems in the Haskell language.

We welcome any help from you!

## How can you help

Issues, questions, bugs and features are in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vsha96/mllib/issues). According to this, you can help in the following ways:  

    1) Write or improve documentation.

    2) Investigate bugs.

    3) Suggest new features.

    4) Contribute code. No matter whether it's a small fix or a huge lump of code - help is welcome.

    5) Help others in the issue tracker.

If you haven't found the right template, use `New feature` template. We will add it or help you to find the most suitable!

## See an empty file in [/src/Mllib](https://github.com/vsha96/mllib/tree/main/src/Mllib)?

Implement the model or functions!

See more info in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vsha96/mllib/issues). If you don't see a ticket for this file, add it according to the `New model` or `New feature` template.

## Basic principles when implementing a model
[See the principles in the HOW-TO-WRITE-MODEL.md](https://github.com/vsha96/mllib/blob/main/docs/HOW_TO_WRITE_MODEL.md)


## Linter

We are using [hlint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint) to check the code.

To run the linter, use `make lint`.

## Testing

[See how to test in the HOW-TO-TEST.md](https://github.com/vsha96/mllib/blob/main/docs/HOW_TO_TEST.md)
